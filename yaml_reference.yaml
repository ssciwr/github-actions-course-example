# This is a (non-exhaustive) reference of the YAML syntax used in GitHub Actions
# Note that advanced parts of the YAML spec like anchors are not supported.


# The top-level document is always a mapping

# Values can be strings, numbers and boolean values 
somestring: value1
somenumber: 42
someboolean: true

# Strings can also be split across multiple lines
multilinestring: |
  abc
  def
 
# Also lists can be realized in two ways:
alist:
 - a
 - b
shortlist: [a, b]

# Mappings can be nested by using indentation
amapping:
  key1: bla

# This can be repeated to arbitrary depth
deepernesting:
  nested:
    foo: bar
  empty:

# Mappings and lists can be combined
listofmappings:
  - foo: bar
    bar: foo
  - foo: bar
    bar: foo
