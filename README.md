This is the example repository for the SSC course "Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions".

It contains a rather simple, no-op Python package.

There is a number of branches. Switching between then allows you to skip over parts of the material:

* `main` is the starting point of the course. It only contains the no-op Python package.
* `hello-world` adds a workflow that prints Hello World upon push to any branch
* `triggering-conditions` shows what events can trigger workflows
* `job-steps` goes into the details of how to specify what should be done in a workflow
* `variability` shows how combinatoric jobs can be defined
